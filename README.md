# H1  Web Portfolio
1. Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes.
2. What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?
My first difficulties began with understanding bootstrap and how to use it correctly, I was able to learn thanks to the fact that I watched a huge number of videos on YouTube. The next difficulties arose with how to make the site ==responsive== and how to install elements in the order I need. I had several minor problems with the design of the site and its structuring, but it seems like I more or less learned how to do it. In general, it seems to me that I need much more time to complete this task than I thought before.
I learned very useful skills in working with bootstrap, I roughly understand how to use it. In the process of work, I learned many skills in working with code. I am grateful to this task for helping me better understand my weaknesses and improve my knowledge.
